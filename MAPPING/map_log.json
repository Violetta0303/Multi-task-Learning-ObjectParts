On the other hand, 'rock' as a verb means to move gently back and forth or from side to side. In this context, you can indeed 'rock' a 'cradle', meaning to gently sway the infant's bed.\n\nHowever, 'rock' has various other meanings which do not relate to 'cradle' at all. As a noun, it could mean a large mass of stone forming a hill, cliff, promontory, or the like, or it could refer to a genre of music.\n\nThe words 'cradle' and 'rock' are connected in some contexts, but they are not interchangeable or synonymous in the way 'coffee machine' and 'coffee maker' are.\n\nFinal answer: No."

A cupboard is typically smaller, often found in kitchens or dining rooms, and used to store dishes, food, or small items. It is usually enclosed by hinged doors. A closet, on the other hand, is typically larger and is used to store clothes, shoes, or other larger objects. It can be a small, enclosed space in a room or can occupy an entire room.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that their use may vary based on regional English. For example, in British English, 'cupboard' can often refer to what Americans would call a 'closet'.\n\nGiven our criteria \u2014 real-world accuracy and following the majority of usage, one can say while they are relatives in the larger category of storage spaces, 'cupboard' and 'closet' aren't the same.

Dressing gowns can be of many different materials, not necessarily absorbent.\n\nYet in many parts of the world, especially in British English, the terms 'bathrobe' and 'dressing gown' are often used interchangeably for any loose gown worn at home, the nuances being less enforced in everyday language.

However, there's a regional difference in the usage of these terms. In British English, the term \"spanner\" is most commonly used, whereas in American English, the same tool is typically referred to as a \"wrench\".\n\nThat being said, to an American, a spanner might have a slightly more specific reference, typically to an open-end wrench. But these are minor differences in a largely overlapping basic function.\n\nLooking at the provided example of \"coffee machine\" and \"coffee maker\", the difference between \"spanner\" and \"wrench\" seems similar in degree. Both \"spanner\" and \"wrench\" serve the same primary function, even if they are known by different names in different regions or have minor variations in form.\n\nFinal answer: Yes."
